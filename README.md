📖 Overview

This package provides implementations of essential data structures in
Go, including graphs and other commonly used structures. It is designed
to help developers efficiently manage and manipulate data while
maintaining code simplicity and readability.

✨ Features

✅ Implementation of Graph data structures. ✅ Utility functions for
adding nodes and edges. ✅ Easy-to-use API for creating and managing
data structures.

🔧 Installation

To use this package in your Go project, first ensure you have Go
installed. Then, initialize a Go module and install the package:

# Initialize a new Go module (if not already done)

go mod init github.com/yourusername/yourrepo

🚀 Usage

🔹 Creating a Graph

Below is an example demonstrating how to create and use a graph:

package main

import ( "fmt" "github.com/beingbravado/go-data-structures/graph" )

func main() { g := graph.NewGraph() g.AddEdge(1, 2) g.AddEdge(2, 3)
g.AddEdge(3, 4)

    fmt.Println("Graph Nodes:", g.Nodes())

}

🔹 Creating a Graph from Prerequisites

prereqs := \[\]\[\]int{{1, 0}, {2, 0}, {3, 1}, {3, 2}} g :=
graph.CreateGraph(4, prereqs)

🛠 Running Tests
